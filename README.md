# KDownloader-Recoded
Redocode of kdownloader / ipcam-winforms.    

KDownloader is a tool for downloading data from large numbers of IP Cameras    
You put a list of IP Addresses in and it will attempt to download a snapshot from each of them    
You must specify the brand of IP Camera but it does the rest.    

For pentesting applications it also includes implementations of a few well known exploits    
currently it includes the foscam kcore retrival exploit and the hikvision auth bypass exploit.
